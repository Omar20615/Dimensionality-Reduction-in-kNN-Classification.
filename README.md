# Dimensionality-Reduction-in-kNN-Classification.

For this project, I experimented with k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) using different k values and plotted accuracy to find the best k. I applied feature selection, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) to reduce the data dimensions, selecting the most informative features and dimensions. I reported performance based on accuracy, repeated the experiments 5 times with a 70:30 class-wise train-test split, and compared the results.
